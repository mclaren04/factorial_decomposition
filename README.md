# factorial_decomposition
Translate n! into string that contains product of prime numbers of the form "p_1^{c1} * p_2^{c2} * ... p_k".

If power == 1, no "^{c_k}" is required.

For example 6! -> "2^4 * 3^2 * 5"

The program takes 1 natural parameter and outputs its decomposition into prime numbers.
